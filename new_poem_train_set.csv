o that i were where helen lies,2
and keep my senses straightened,2
"his song, though very sweet, was low and faint,",3
"what's de use o' gittin' mopy,",2
she still must keep the locket to allay,2
i think i'll just call up my wife and tell her,2
like morning glory,1
in their archetypes endure.,2
whatever anybody had,2
and seek the danger i was forc’d to shun.,0
that in their holes abed at close of day,2
indignantly i hurled the cry:,0
"from flight, seditious angel, to receave",0
each lodger here adorns the walls:,2
from the hushed and silent tomb.,0
to accomplish suicide.,0
"but, through the war-cloud, pray to thee",3
sith i might some counsel find,2
"i'm comin', ed.",2
that to the next i may resign my roome,2
the tale is one of distant skies;,2
his sweeter voice a just accordance kept.,1
"yet both in different colours hide their art,",2
"and through it, and round it, and over it all",2
"he scarce had ended, when those two approachd",2
mere raft of stone;,2
did this wood come floating thick,2
"listening, with half-suspended breath,",2
fu' to ba' de battle's brunt.,2
with war unhop’d the latians to surprise?,2
shall troy renew’d be forc’d and fir’d again?,2
"how your soft opera-music changed, and the drum and fife were heard in their stead;",3
"whereto we claim sole title by our toil,",2
"his regal seat, surrounded by his friends.",1
my daily thoughts perpetual converse held,2
is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange.,0
yon creamy lily for their pavilion,2
midway the floor (with thatch was it strewn) burned ever the fire-flame,2
"dearest, why should i mourn, whimper, and whine, i that have yet to live?",3
with spring’s delicious trouble in the ground,3
"how they had waited for him, to complete",2
and tell you in what greek and latin name,2
most beauteous isadore!,1
of things that only children see,2
"thy merited reward, the first assay",1
the call's more urgent when he journeys slow.,2
but all of them are bad enough,0
"we hear our mother call from deeps of time,",2
"i turned, and saw behind me surge",2
to that mysterious strand.,2
"you have done this, says one judge; done that, says another;",2
shall live my highland mary.,2
"is passed, and our aereal speed suspended.",2
"a wagon, overarched with evergreen,",2
"with passionate longing burning,",1
"their very peaks transparent. 'ere it fade,'",2
"this hot, sick air! and how i covet here",0
and they whispered to each other:,2
"upon her sister dear,",2
"shall yet be glad for him, and he shall bless",1
"and tender thoughts, and prayers, remains,",1
of robert burns and alexander.,2
"a day's experunce 'd prove to ye, ez easy 'z pull a trigger.",2
"i see them torn by gallic guns,",0
"leading downward to the river,",2
"thou feel'st it burning, in and in,--and fear",0
"of the boulder-strewn mountain, and when they will crop.",2
"gnossian his shafts, and lycian was his bow:",2
and listening to thy home's familiar chime,2
"i would don my hose of homespun gray,",2
ode read at the one hundredth anniversary of the fight at concord bridge,2
o graves of men who lived and died,2
"with peace and soft rapture shall teach life to glow,",1
"to rise upon some other shore,",2
"thus hee in scorn. the warlike angel mov'd,",0
and to thy brief captivity was brought,2
"thither, if but to prie, shall be perhaps",2
feel the pulses of the brave,1
"she falls back from the freedom she had hoped.""",2
"left the torn human heart, their food and dwelling-place.",0
alone went the fair-armed gudrun to her flowery garden-close;,1
even now eclipses the descending moon!--,2
and sate as thus upon that slope of lawn,2
i'm here--so far--and starting on again.,2
in the wild glens rough shepherds will deplore,0
none will forget it till shall fall the deadly dart!,0
how you sprang! how you threw off the costumes of peace with indifferent hand;,3
"""o lord, that didst smother mankind in thy flood,",0
sweet hope!,1
"as round some giant hive, all day and night,",2
"push every outpost nearer,",2
ere i own an usurper i'll couch with the fox;,2
"where your hair from your forehead swerves,",2
the things it wrought on; i believe,2
"and changing like a poet's rhymes,",2
"so thick, she cannot see her lover hiding,",2
and the lure of what is called heaven is little or nothing to me.,3
"are angel faces, silent and serene,",1
but she always ran away and left,0
"said my companion, 'i will show you soon",2
to intercept the sunshine and your face.,2
"first, he mused what the animal substance or herb is",2
"luck obeys the downright striker; from the hollow core,",2
"half the tell-tale south-wind said,--",2
when our mother nature laughs around;,1
"when on the boughs the purple buds expand,",2
i kin eat in peace.,1
live with heav'ns choicest constant blessings crown'd!,1
"rais’d on the seas, the surges to control—",2
"three lives, three strides, three foot-prints in the sand;",2
on us lift up the light,1
"precisely, at all events, what he ought not,",2
and like the others does not slip,2
"the pain when it did live,",0
"_you_ took to follerin' where the prophets beckoned,",2
"in town, an' not the leanest runt",0
"we’ll say instead, the inconsequent creature, man,—",2
i have lost the urban ways.,2
"ay, knelt and worshipped on, as love in beauty's bower,",1
"and hoping chink, she talked of morts of luck:",2
"his boundless gulfs and built his shore, thy breath,",2
"got the ill name of augurs, because they were bores, —)",0
"sooner, augustine, sooner far, shall i",2
"upon whose boughs were wicker cages hung,",2
and so i should be loved and mourned to-night.,3
"such civil war is in my love and hate,",3
"plucked from the death, wilt thou repay me thus?",3
"two mighty cities shone, and ever",1
"he stares, and shakes, and finds it vain to fly;",0
...    and call to him.,2
the crack as of her splitting. did she take,2
"from earth, with the waters of pain.",0
and in a pleasing slumber seals his eyes:,1
"love, on myriad lips fairer than yours, kisses you could not give! . . .",3
"dark with more clouds than tempests are,",0
"that truthful teacup, our dictator, knows;",2
the climax of those hopes and duties dear,1
"except in france; and when it’s found in france,",2
that by nor sound nor word,2
"and then he shut his little eyes,",2
"his bark her anchor weighed,",2
"mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled,",0
"did from the altar steal a smouldering brand,",0
and i've been like that silly girl.,0
"in every health we drink, my boys,",2
godminster? is it fancy's play?,2
"smoothing the clustered hair, and parting it",2
"that thou should'st smile again?""--the evening came,",2
on thine own bird the sweet enthusiasm,1
‘received that cheque.’ but you!... i send you funds,2
"mind us of like repose, since god hath set",2
the beauty and the joy of their renewed might.,1
"when your rights was our wrongs, john,",3
no answer came; but faint and forlorn,0
"""play uppe, play uppe, o boston bells!",1
"to match your wit against the maker's will,",2
attend your brother to the stygian flood.”,2
"yearns to its source. the spirit thirsts for god,",2

early or late? or shall that commonwealth,2
"as if we guessed what hers have been,",2
while brain wore a plumeless casque; not he,2
"when thou hadst overcome the sharpness of death, thou didst open the kingdom of heaven to all believers.",3
but if thou do thy best,2
their names let hands of horn and tan,2

"he plays a little, sings a song,",2
"some come ridin' in top-buggies wid de w'eels all painted red,",2
"with shame his glowing cheeks, his eyes with fury burn’d.",0
"when the brow is cold as the marble stone,",0
which clanged along the mountain's marble brow--,2
"is shorter than a snake's delay,",2
"to paris, and you make no sign at all.",2
it spoils me for the smiling of the rest’—,1
"trailing, wrecked, it came to land,",0
with pale blue berries. in these peaceful shades--,1
"but she spake: ""bid hither gunnar, lest the sun sink o'er the bent,",2
"nor the president in his presidency, nor the rich in his great house.",3
"how weak this tinkling line,",0
wait his returning strength.,2
"was in cremona's workshops made,",2
they had not set there. who had set it there?,2
"you'll not want business, for we need a lot",2
tis gone past recalling!,2
did all of them bow downward towards that side,2
"no, no, you have dismiss'd me; and i go",2
"who, never looking forward, are indeed",2
ran ever clearer speech than that did run,1
"and while before me, spotted with white sails,",2
this endless outrage shall they still sustain?,0
upon the thought of perfect noon. and when,1
"would split, for size of me.",2
and breaths were gathering sure,2
and i am still the same;,2
"a fleecy cloud,",2
"""before god, sir, i vow, when you are gone,",2
"yea, soon, no consonant unsmooth",2
the beacon-light that forth they held,2
"but, fixing on the horrid maid his eye,",0
"the which she bearing home it burned her nest,",0
o'er time's delusive tide.,0
"first feels the gathering head of steam,",2
"before the saintly soul, whose human will",1
and bright in heaven's jewelled crown,1
"but the great spirit plants it in our hearts,",2
"augmented, sweet, a hundred fold",1
and make the liveliest monkey melancholy.,0
fall again.,2
"nightly down the river going,",2
"youth, i do adore thee;",1
does beauty slight you from her gay abodes?,3
lowly and soft she said it; but spake out louder now:,2
"the fraud of priests, the wrong of law,",0
glad on its stone-built hearth; and thorough the wide-mouthed smoke-flue,2
"some moment, nailed on sorrow's cross,",0
who digs last year's potato hill?--,2
long-drawn bill of wine and beer,2
"and fears are added, and avenging flame.",0
and lips where heavenly smiles would hang and blend,1
"all along down ""injin crik?""",2
for peace or rest too well he saw,2
"then loosen, launch forth, to go and compete,",2
"at last, outbound from tunis,",2
is lovely round; a beautiful river there,1
"is plain, thou say'st: but wherefore god this way",2
"the fear of angels, awful though they be,",0
and yon outlying range invites,2
many changes have been run,2
"the play is done,--the curtain drops,",2
"o so many, many, many",2
godminster chimes,2
"the love that lived through all the stormy past,",3
"a privilege, i think,",2
beneath thy gracious feet!,1
"the dusky daughter of the sun,--",2
"""thou of the god-lent crown,",2
as when i read in god's own holy book.,2
"they are fastened well, nom d'un chien!",2

"young childhood, with a moisten'd eye,",2
"(distinctly here the spirit sneezed,)",2
"even hearts estranged would turn once more to me,",3
if men are always at a loss,0
"and, wildly tossed from cheeks and chin,",2
until my latest breath.,2
"then oer the rushes flies again,",2
rang the beautiful wild chimes,1
"betrayed how mightily its heart was stirred,",3
"her visions and those we have seen,--",2
"far out, in peace, the white man's sail",2
"god prosper long our noble king,",1
down in the west upon the ocean floor,2
"in slumber; for thine enemy never sleeps,",0
"like your nest,",2
"in all that clang and hewing out of men,",2
"an old smoaked blanket arches oer his head,",2

"and wit, like ocean, rose and fell?--",3
how heavy it seemed! as heavy as a stone;,0
and bow to dread inquisitor and worship lords of dust;,0
"where holds the soul communion with its god,",2
how they will tell the shipwreck,2
strong tarchon snatch’d and bore away his prize.,1
"and i greet from far the ray,",2
"leave the garden walls, where blow",2
and glance securely round.,2
and politician at odd seasons.,2
"in three distinguish’d parts, with three distinguish’d guides",2
"take the warm welcome of new friends with thee,",1
"with its close-curling gold, and love revived.",1
a golden helm his front and head surrounds,2
"from his own tripod, and his holy tree;",2
rejection of his humanness,0

with sincerest conviction their chairs to the shore;,1
"sat mournfully guarding their corpses there,",0
"ho! philip, send, for charity, thy mexican pistoles,",2
"he takes you from your easy-chair,",2
so runs the perfect cycle of the year.,1
"a thousand rubs had flattened down each little cherub's nose,",2
and ever the rocks' disdain;,0
"and stiff in fight, but serious drill's despair,",0
"sounded o'er earth and sea its blast of war,",0
and the rude people rage with ignorant cries,0
come up like ocean murmurs. but the scene,2
"‘these monsters, set out in the open sun,",0
when lips and heart refuse to part again,2
me honied paths forsake;,2
their country free and joyous--,1
sweet poesy from heaven,1
have i played in different countries.,2
"nor is he, as some sages swear,",2
"i watch you in your crystal sphere,",2
"from god's design, with threads of rain!",2
then he stripped the shirt of wampum,2
very sleepy with the silence.,2
to me that time did not appeire:,2
"that you or yours, having an appetite,",2
"(so thick they crowd), 'tis hardly seen.",2
"let fall on her a rose-leaf rain of dreams,",1
inexorable death; and claims his right.,0
the habitable earth is full of bliss;,1
"in the twilight of age all things seem strange and phantasmal,",0
came sages urging on his foamy steed:,2
his head is bowed. he thinks on men and kings.,2
while with thy childlike faith we lean,2
the other dark-eyed dears,2
"will seek the half unjeweled tide,",2
"daring to ask for naught, and having naught received.",2
a wild and stormy sea;,0
"thou too art victor, rochambeau!",1
"and sorrowful to-day, thy children set",0
"but it is not enough, ah! not enough",2
"i strive, i pray.",1
"and then, as is my wont, i told",2
it's a pretty early start.,2
"where the moloch of slavery sitteth on high,",0
thy hands all cunning arts that women prize.,1
"miles off, three dangerous miles, is home;",0
wilt thou forget the love that joined us here?,2
with level wings swinging,2
skirting the stream.,2
the tribute of this verse.,2
"he bent and kissed her head, warm, shining, soft,",1
"the crown of sorrow on their heads, their loss",0
our lives and safeties all;,2
till after-poets only knew,2
"apple-blossoms pink, and low",2
of peace? it is thy father's name. thy life,2
and circling wonders fill the vast profound.,1
an hundred silken cords are set,2
"unhitched the breeching from a shaft,",2
the story of a spavined steed;,2
whose potent unity and concentric force,1
i sate down beneath the beech,2
then to tell.,2
heart as though with ashes blending;,0
the life of love that gave it--settles.,1
which goaded him in his distress,0
"for her this rhyme is penned, whose luminous eyes,",1
he sat beside the governor and said grace;,2
"--so they feast in the hall of atli, and that eve is the first of the seven.",1
but homesick tears would fill the eyes,0
"crouching and sleeping neath its grassy lair,",2
whose anvil's even din,2
"fix’d on the walls with wonder and surprise,",1
ashes and jet all hues outshine.,1
but descend to the ocean again.,2
robe us once more in heaven-aspiring creeds,1
"the china dustless, the keen knife-blades bright,",1
"of common, natural things a part,",2
"the sower scatters broad his seed,",2
"envy and calumny and hate and pain,",0
"burns in thee, child?--what good can thee betide,",2
"“the nymph, who scatters flaming fires around,",0
the very gods arising mid their carven images:,2
so that my stern resolve was almost gone.,2
the head that lay against your knees,2
"""sir, i have dreamed of you. i pray you, sir,",2
less often man--the harder of the two.,2
one lucent foot's delaying tip,2
"and then, if it should be",2
to hold it fast.,2
"eliab this occasion seized,",2
"no, truly.--i will see her; tell my tale,",2
"down the dark future, through long generations,",0
"the present is enough, for common souls,",2
"and hold the hours as joshua stayed the sun,--",2
"""onaway! my heart sings to thee,",1
"ah, what a pang of aching sharp surprise",0
"daily struggling, though unloved and lonely,",0
"euryalus stood list’ning while he spoke,",2
bedaubed with iridescent dirt.,2
jarr'd his own golden region; and before,2
"""sir, ye shall find him, if ye follow up",2
"whose voices, hushed, have left our pathway lonely,",0
bred onely and completed to the taste,2
"on winter afternoons,",2
begins to live,2
"but she guesses he is near,",2
to his aid the strong reverses,2
how many times we must have met,2
"the second signal sounds, the troop divides",2
"flutter,",2
the blessed memory of thy worth,1
"unclasped the rusty belt beneath,",2
that little barley-cake you keep from him,2
"returne, the starres of morn shall see him rise",2
"weak, timid, homesick, slow to understand",0
"the leprous corpse, touched by this spirit tender,",3

"whom phoebus taught unerring prophecy,",2
"in order, though to nations yet unborn,",2
"all passionate-sweet, as are the loving beams",1
"and, laying snow-white flowers against my hair.",2
the pyramids have risen.,2
"meekly in the eternal footsteps trod,",2
hale as the morn and happy as her song.,1
"at least if so we can, and by the head",2
oblivion's blankness claims,0
the deer invites no longer,2
sings the blackened log a tune,2
and on her ample square from side to side,2
"what once has been and ne'er shall be again,",2
she of the rugged sides--,2
"of the bivouac fire apart,",2
"""is this a nightmare, or am i",0
and in some deep and narrow bay then sleeps,2

that day.,2

no word for a while spake regin; but he hung his head adown,0
but thrown in a heap with a crush and a clatter;,0
