where the warm life we cannot see--,1
nile shall pursue his changeless way:,2
"in our embraces we again enfold her,",1
of my wit or in my mind,2
for the greek must ask elsewhere.,2
--the drones of the community; they feed,2
she sought for flowers,2
"would my heart and life flow onward, deathward, through this dream of",3
his silent sandals swept the mossy green;,2
"with england if the day go hard,",2
"our present, our past, our to be,",2
honour to the bugle-horn!,1
"o, mind ye, luve, how aft we left",2
"by a great master of the past,",1
"those hours the ancient timepiece told,--",2
misnames as the dog rosey now.,2
full of the calm that cometh after sleep:,1
an honest tongue may drop a harmless hint.,1
"for penance, by a saintly styrian monk",2
"""does he mean himself, i wonder?",2
thy mission to a world of woe.,0
"on that shaded day,",2
but god said,2
"you turn, o jeanne, on our mystery",2
"his hand the captive's fetters broke,",0
"howled through the dark, like sounds from hell.",0
"the mad briareus of disunion rise,",0
"then--i would gather it, to thee unaware,",2
to his ears there came a murmur of far seas beneath the wind,2
whilst this....,2
time never did assuage;,2
"men said, into a smile which guile portended,",0
"all autumn pil'd, though spring and autumn here",2
here on the cliff beneath the oleanders,2
"and full of wonder, full of hope as he.",1
"swing, like a ship at anchor, roun' my base,",2
who felt your own thought worthy of record,1
"looks, and is dumb with awe;",3
not in the close successive rattle,2
gay little heart!,1
"flew to and fro,",2
like slippers after shoes.--,2
"but heaven in thy creation did decree,",2
"taking and giving radiance, and the slopes",1
my prayer away i threw;,2
"sky, marsh, my soul, and yonder sail.",2

"how the white mountain-tops distinctly shine,",1
"till, fur 'z i know, there aint an inch thet i could lay my han' on,",2
"flood his black hearthstone till its flames expire,",0
beneath the hazel bough;,2
"and then, to go to sleep;",2
"""he whose lot hath been",2
"a level space of nameless graves,--",2
three trojans tug at ev’ry lab’ring oar;,2
"far, far away, o ye",2
"their heads, distilling gore, his chariot grace.",3
"they say that 'time assuages,' --",2
"swifter was the hunter's rowing,",1
to touch such goodness with a grimy palm.,3
"thinks i, the down lies dreaming",2
the poet comes the last!,2
to teach in schools of little country towns,2
"and thus each tint or shade which falls,",2
"fit for an abbot of theleme,",2
with the _quart d'heure_ of rabelais!,2
if the pure and holy angels,1
"thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned,",1
of course throw monstrous shadows: those who think,0
they shaped our future; we but carve their names.,2
who god possesseth,2
for that’s his specialty. what creature else,2
"as o'er the earth it wanders wide,",2
"from alton bay to sandwich dome,",2
"through the salt sea foam,",2
it will be spring again.,2
glory might burst on us!,1
like those famed seven who slept three ages.,2
"no, i won't be seein' nobody in the mornin',",2
"has it become to thee a labyrinth never ending,",0
"and when they reached the house,",2
and what are all the prizes won,2
"and country eyes, and quiet faces --",2
"thus farr to try thee, adam, i was pleas'd,",1
"dead among the shouting people,",0
abloom by sacred streams,1
he might have been as doubtful once,2
"here on the street as strangers do,",2
"""i say it's someone passing.""",2
"they beached their galley on the shore, and sought",2
the lady eunice such a life she flew,2
came in slow pomp;--the moving pomp might seem,2
"warped into adamantine fretwork, hung",2
"busy, with sacerdotal tailorings",2
"but no tidings thread the gloom,",0
"how hearts were answering to his own,",1
"all hastening onward, yet none seemed to know",2
"when thee, the eyes of that harsh long ago",0
roamed amongst the roses white and red.,2
"with dews of tropic morning wet,",2
"for the whole cardinals' college, or",2
since ferdinand and you begun,2
"now rise and look upon me.""  and she rose,",2
made snow of all the blossoms; at my feet,2
"you hardly know when you are coming back,",2
"mine are calm and tranquil days,",1
a simple strain--,2
"or by some cabin door, a bush",2
and leaves the world to darkness and to me.,0
"and all their echoes, mourn;",0
"still, upon a flower,",2
"already, land! thou hast declared:  'tis done.",1
"blindness like that would scare the mole and bat,",0
"an angel had not startled him,",2
"breathe deep, and start, to see him pass the door.",2
i cannot tell rude listeners,0
fifty times the brahmins' offer deluged all the floor.,2
"a orn'ment o' saciety, in my approprut spear:",2
"each by his fiery torture howl and rave,",0
with warning cough and threatening wheeze,0
"begins, but endeth nevermore;",2
"skins of otter, lynx, and ermine,",2
and sleigh-bells a-jingle,2
and when i bade the dream,2
"and the old swallow-haunted barns,--",0
my breast was calm as summer's sea,1
tis that one told us it was life. 'for not,2
three hours the first november dawn,2
"thou wovest dreams of joy and fear,",3
in some lady's gyahden.,2
"""who's we?--some stockholders in boston?",2
"that we must change for heav'n, this mournful gloom",0
until the bitter summons fell--,0
and not alone by gold;,2
"may george, beloved by all the nations round,",1
"turn'd back the shafts, and mock'd the gates of death,",0
"lift not your hands in the banded war,",2
you heard the news from vincent carrington.,2
taught by the sorrows that his age had known,0
"on her changed world of ruin, waste and wrack,",0
"and raised their eyes above,",2
"amidst the gold and the purple, and the pillows of his bed:",2
sent by an hand unseen;,2
and give a meaning to their lives; and still,2
"some thought of me, a last fond prayer",1
who wrote this modest version i suppose,2
"and say, ‘fie, pale-face! are you english girls",2
"from the pulpit read the preacher, ""goodman garvin and his wife",2
the wondering rabbi sought the temple's gate.,2
"to wakeful frenzy's vigil--rages,",0
the adulterate death of lucrece and her groom.,0
"i'm safe enlisted fer the war,",2
"good ringers, pull your best,"" quoth he.",1
"it would be different if more people came,",2
"if they are hungry, paradise",2
"the soul with sweetness, and like an adept",1
"""i rather should have hewn your limbs away,",0
when high i heap it with the weed,2
above the myriad roofs and spires rise;,2
around thy place of slumber glowing!,1
my winter sports begin.,2
"they were wet, and glistened with raindrops, shed",2
"the weird pathetic scarlet of day dawning,",0
"a man in the wars delighting, blind-eyed through right and wrong:",3
all foredoomed to melt away;,0
and willing grow old,2
"while from his hand i squeeze the golden prize,",2
"the oriole in the elm; the noisy jay,",2
bird that from the nadir's floor,2
turn in the door once and turn once only,2
of inward strife for truth and liberty.,3
"upon a mountain crag, young angelo--",2
"yet by experience taught we know how good,",2
"a fragrance from the cedars, thickly set",2
"tell me, the charms that lovers seek",2
"where wisdom and not numbers should have weight,",2
for suddenly the sweet bells overcame,1
and murmured a strange and solemn air;,0
"with its chang'd countenance, is sent away",2
"concerning him ye wot of, thus to think",2
"best gems of nature's cabinet,",1
and at my door they cower and die.,0
"for ever, if that maiden sits enshrined",2
"""he!  patron!",2
"the former, as the slacken’d reins he drew",2
"how poor these pallid phrases seem,",0
"forelaid and taken, while he strove in vain",0
"for 'twas e'en as a great god's slaying, and they feared the wrath of the sky;",0
the hostile cohorts melt away;,3
the wood giant,2
"as george commands, let him be wrong or right,",2
"from the bed of minnehaha,",2
as if she were a woman. we who have clipt,2
’tis to behold his vengeance for my son.,0
"and _channing_, with his bland, superior look,",3
"he says he’s hungry,—he would rather have",2
"pilgrim and soldier, saint and sage,",2
"an echo returned on the cold gray morn,",0
but because she stept to her star right on through death,3
"blood-dipped arrows, which savages make",0
that passed with you and me.--,2
her eye proclaims her of the briton line:,2
blow bigger then your own:  the games we play,2
"or at the church, she ever bore herself",2
the echoing sounds grow fainter and then cease;,2
"her lion-port, her awe-commanding face,",1
through swiftly changing season.,2
"in yonder green meadow, to memory dear,",1
"you didn't stop for fuss,--",2
as childhood's sweet delight.,1
still in hot and heavy splashes fell the tears on every leaf.,0
henceforth to labor's chivalry,2
when hills are free from snow,2
"around my will to link it with her own,",2
he has no calling and he owns no trade.,2
honour to the old bow-string!,1
"to feel, with bird and stream and tree,",2
that saw the cross without the bear.,2
i must be home by noon-time with the cart.',2
